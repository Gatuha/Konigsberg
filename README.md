The Königsberg problem is a famous historical puzzle in mathematics that involves a network of bridges and islands in the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). The problem asks whether it is possible to take a walk through the city, crossing each of the seven bridges once and only once, and return to the starting point.

The problem was first analyzed by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century, and he showed that it is impossible to find such a path. Euler's solution led to the development of graph theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with networks, nodes, and connections. Euler's work on the Königsberg problem laid the foundation for graph theory and has had a significant impact on various fields, including computer science and network analysis.
